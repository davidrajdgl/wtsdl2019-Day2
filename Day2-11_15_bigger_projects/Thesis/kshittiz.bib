abstract="A signed graph is obtained from a graph when each line is given either a positive or a negative sign. We now define a 
marked graph analogously by signing the points of a graph. In both of these the sign of a cycle is the product of the signs of the 
lines or points, respectively. In a balanced signed graph or in a consistent marked graph, every cycle is positive. Our object is 
to investigate consistent marked graphs. It is shown that if such a graph has both positive and negative points, it cannot be 
highly connected; more precisely, it is not 3-connected. We conclude with a series of constructions which show that a given 
consistent marked graph can often be reduced to smaller ones.",
